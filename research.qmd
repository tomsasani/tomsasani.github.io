I develop and apply computational methods to study mutation rate and spectrum evolution in mammalian genomes. Here are a few research questions I've pursued in the past: 

#### How does inherited genetic variation impact the germline mutation rate?

> Related paper: [**A natural mutator allele shapes mutation spectrum variation in mice**](nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04701-5)

#### To what degree do mutation rates vary among human families?

> Related paper: [**Large, three-generation human families reveal post-zygotic mosaicism and variability in germline mutation accumulation**](https://elifesciences.org/articles/46922)

#### How do structural and single-nucleotide variants interact to promote rapid adaptation?
