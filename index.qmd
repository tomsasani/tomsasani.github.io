Iâ€™m a computational biologist using genetic data to better understand health and evolution.

### Experience

I'm currently a (remote) **Staff Research Scientist** with [Dr. Aaron Quinlan](http://quinlanlab.org/) at the University of Utah, where I develop new methods to study the evolution of germline mutation rates and spectra.

As a **Postdoctoral Fellow** with [Dr. Kelley Harris](https://sites.google.com/site/harriskelley/home) at the University of Washington, I discovered genetic modifiers of the germline mutation rate in mice.

In between my academic roles I was also a **Senior Data Scientist** at [Recursion Pharmaceuticals](https://www.recursion.com/), where I analyzed data from massive cellular imaging experiments to identify new treatments for human disease.
