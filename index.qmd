Iâ€™m a computational biologist using genetic data to better understand health and evolution.

## Experience

#### Staff Research Scientist with [Dr. Aaron Quinlan](http://quinlanlab.org/)

> **2022 - present**: developing new methods to analyze germline mutation and [find mutator alleles](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.89096.1)

#### Senior Data Scientist @ [Recursion Pharmaceuticals](https://www.recursion.com/)

> **2021 - 2022**: analyzed data from massive cellular imaging experiments to find new disease treatments

#### Postdoctoral Fellow with [Dr. Kelley Harris](https://sites.google.com/site/harriskelley/home)

> **2020 - 2021**: discovered [genetic modifiers of the germline mutation rate in mice](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04701-5)

#### Graduate Student with [Dr. Aaron Quinlan](http://quinlanlab.org/)

> **2015 - 2020**: characterized [patterns of germline mutation in large human families](https://elifesciences.org/articles/46922)
