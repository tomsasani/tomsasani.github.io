**I’m a computational biologist using genetic data to better understand health and evolution.**

Currently, I’m a Senior Data Scientist at [Recursion Pharmaceuticals.](https://www.recursion.com/)

Previously, I was a NIH T32 Postdoctoral Fellow with [Dr. Kelley Harris](https://sites.google.com/site/harriskelley/home) at the University of Washington, where I used whole-genome sequencing data to [discover genetic modifiers of the germline mutation rate in mice.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04701-5)

Before that, I defended a Ph.D in Human Genetics with [Dr. Aaron Quinlan](http://quinlanlab.org/) at the University of Utah. My graduate research focused on [characterizing patterns of germline mutation](https://elifesciences.org/articles/46922) in large human families and [tracking viral evolution](https://elifesciences.org/articles/35453) using long read sequencing technologies.
