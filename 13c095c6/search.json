Essentially, VQSR takes in a few ‚Äútruth sets,‚Äù which are just VCF files containing variants considered to be either ‚Äúvery good‚Äù or ‚Äúvery bad,‚Äù so that GATK can get a feeling for the qualities that make a ‚Äúgood variant.‚Äù But first, we need to get a hold of these truth sets.\n\nDownloading GATK resources for VQSR\nGATK hosts its ‚Äúresource bundle,‚Äù containing various files that are important for running GATK, on Google. The four truth sets we can use are hosted here.\nTo download, we can use a tool called gsutil, developed by Google specifically for fetching files from Google Cloud.\n# download \"omni\" truth set\n/path/to/gsutil cp gs://genomics-public-data/resources/broad/hg38/v0/1000G_omni2.5.hg38.vcf.gz\n# download \"hapmap\" truth set\n/path/to/gsutil cp gs://genomics-public-data/resources/broad/hg38/v0/hapmap_3.3.hg38.vcf.gz\n# download \"1000G\" truth set\n/path/to/gsutil cp gs://genomics-public-data/resources/broad/hg38/v0/1000G_phase1.snps.high_confidence.hg38.vcf.gz\n# download \"dbsnp\" truth set\n/path/to/gsutil cp gs://genomics-public-data/resources/broad/hg38/v0/Homo_sapiens_assembly38.dbsnp138.vcf\nWe‚Äôll also need the tabix indices for these VCFs, which can also be download from the Google Cloud repository, or done by hand. The ‚Äúdbsnp‚Äù truth set also needs to be bgzip-ed!\n\n\nRunning VQSR\nNow that we‚Äôve collected the various files we need, we can run VQSR. Importantly, VQSR does not output VCF files. Instead it outputs a .recal file and a .tranches file, which are ‚Äúapplied‚Äù to the previous VCF file in the final step of calibration.\nA couple of notes here:\n\nwe can specify exactly which annotations we want VQSR to add by specifying -an multiple times\nwe can specify the ‚Äútranches‚Äù we want VQSR to divide our variants into by specifying tranche multiple times\nin GATK v4.1.8.1, we must include a space between the --resource truth set info and the path to the truth set\nit looks as though GATK now has a convolutional neural net approach to VQSR in GATK v4+ for single samples (see here)\n\nMore detailed documentation on running VQSR (for human data) is here.\ngatk VariantRecalibrator \\\n    --variant {input} \\\n    --output {recal_file_output} \\\n    --tranches-file {tranch_file_output} \\\n    -an QD -an MQRankSum -an ReadPosRankSum -an FS -an SOR \\\n    --mode SNP \\\n    --trust-all-polymorphic true \\\n    --java-options \"-Xmx8G\" \\\n    -tranche 100.0 -tranche 99.95 -tranche 99.9 -tranche 99.8 -tranche 99.6 -tranche 99.5 -tranche 99.0 -tranche 98.0 -tranche 97.0 -tranche 90.0 \\\n    --resource:omni,known=false,training=true,truth=true,prior=12 /path/to/1000G_omni2.5.hg38.vcf.gz \\\n    --resource:1000G,known=false,training=true,truth=false,prior=10 /path/to/1000G_phase1.snps.high_confidence.hg38.vcf.gz \\\n    --resource:hapmap,known=false,training=true,truth=true,prior=15 /path/to/hapmap_3.3.hg38.vcf.gz \\\n    --resource:dbsnp,known=true,training=false,truth=false,prior=7 /path/to/Homo_sapiens_assembly38.dbsnp138.vcf.gz\n\n\nApplying VQSR\nNow, we arrive at the final step of VQSR. Here, we use the .tranches and .recal files produced in the previous step, and ‚Äúapply‚Äù them to the VCF produced in the first step of this section.

    "text": "Motivation\nThere are few (if any) scientific questions that you can answer by running a single program or script. Calling variants involves aligning reads, sorting reads, indexing reads, running a variant caller, filtering those calls, etc. Running a simulation will inevitably require changing parameters or including new combinations of those parameters.\nAnd there are few (if any) programs or scripts that will run/compile correctly on the first try, due to either user error, code bugs, dependency conflicts, improperly configured environments, or any combination therein.\nFor these reasons, it‚Äôs often crucial to package the various steps of your analysis into a ‚Äúpipeline.‚Äù Ideally, this pipeline would accept a file(s) as input, do some stuff with that file, and generate an output file(s). For example, your pipeline might take a FASTQ file and reference genome FASTA as input, and output an aligned, sorted, and indexed BAM.\nIn theory, a pipeline could just be a Bash script in which you enumerate each step of the process. But what if you want to run the pipeline on hundreds of samples‚Äô FASTQ files? And what if the final step in your Bash script fails? You‚Äôll have to re-run the entire pipeline all over again.\nThis is where Snakemake comes in. Snakemake is a flexible Python-based pipeline manager, and it‚Äôs even tuned for running on the Sage Grid Engine (or pretty much any other compute environment).\n\nAs an example, let‚Äôs imagine that we want to take paired-end FASTQ from 3 different mouse samples (A, B, and C) and generate a preliminary set of variant calls for each sample.\n\n\nTo start, let‚Äôs imagine we only want to process one sample: A."

    "text": "Using expand to run a pipeline on many samples or with many parameters\nLet‚Äôs say that once we‚Äôve produced aligned and sorted BAMs, we want to then run a simple variant calling program on each sample‚Äôs alignments.\nTo speed up execution of the variant calling pipeline, it might help to parallelize our pipeline to run on every chromosome separately.\nTo do this, we‚Äôll again make use of expand.\nsamples = [\"A\", \"B\", \"C\"]\n\nchromosomes = list(range(1, 20))\nchromosomes = list(map(str, chromosomes))\nchromosomes.extend(['X', 'Y'])\n\nrule all:\n  input:\n    expand(\"{sample}.{chrom}.vcf\", sample=samples, chrom=chromosomes)\n\nrule download_reference:\n  input: \n  output:\n    \"GRCm38.primary_assembly.genome.fa.gz\"\n  shell:\n    \"\"\"\n    wget ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/gencode/Gencode_mouse/release_M10/GRCm38.primary_assembly.genome.fa.gz\n    \"\"\"\n\nrule bwa_align:\n  input: \n    ref = \"GRCm38.primary_assembly.genome.fa.gz\",\n    fq1 = \"{sample}_1.fastq.gz\",\n    fq2 = \"{sample}_2.fastq.gz\"\n  output:\n    \"{sample}.sorted.bam\"\n  shell:\n    \"\"\"\n    bwa mem -t 4 {input.ref} {input.fq1} {input.fq2} | sambamba view -S -f bam /dev/stdin | sambamba sort -o {output} /dev/stdin\n    \"\"\"\n\nrule call_variants:\n  input:\n    ref = \"GRCm38.primary_assembly.genome.fa.gz\",\n    bam = \"{sample}.sorted.bam\"\n  output:\n    \"{sample}.{chrom}.vcf\"\n  shell:\n    \"\"\"\n    freebayes -f {input.ref} -r {wildcards.chrom} {input.bam} > {output}\n    \"\"\"\n\nWe‚Äôve now added a step to the pipeline which takes a reference genome and a BAM as input, and outputs a variant call file (VCF).\n\n\nNotice that in the call_variants rule, my freebayes command takes a -r argument that specifies the region we want to analyze. Whenever you want to access a wildcard inside of the shell: portion of a rule, its necessary to preface the wildcard name with wildcard.\n\nAnd in this example, expand takes the Cartesian product (i.e., itertools.product()) of the lists of parameters. So, the output of expand would be:\n>>> expand(\"{sample}.{chrom}.vcf\", sample=samples, chrom=chromosomes)\n\n[\"A.chr1.vcf\",\n \"A.chr2.vcf\",\n \"A.chr3.vcf\",\n ...\n \"C.chrY.vcf\"]\nThis way, we can enumerate every possible combination of input parameters instead of typing out 3 * 21 separate commands."

    "text": "Running a Snakemake pipeline on the Sage Grid Engine (SGE)\nIn our lab, we use the SGE to submit and manage compute jobs on the cluster. Snakemake is actually compatible with SGE (and SLURM, etc.), which makes it super easy to submit jobs to SGE directly from a Snakemake pipeline.\nAs an example, we could execute our pipeline as follows:\nsnakemake -j 10 \\\n      --cluster \\\n      --rerun-incomplete \\\n       \"qsub -l centos=7 -l mfree=16G -l h_rt=12:0:0 -o /path/to/outdir -e /path/to/errdir\"\n\nThe -j flag specifies the maximum number of jobs Snakemake is allowed to submit to SGE at a time.\n\n\nThe --rerun-incomplete flag is awesome. If we run our pipeline and it fails for some reason, using --rerun-incomplete will tell Snakemake to re-run a rule if the output of that rule is incomplete (i.e., if the rule didn‚Äôt finish due to a job failure in the last pipeline execution).\n\n\nAfter specifying --cluster, we just put the normal qsub command we‚Äôd normally use to submit a .sh or .sge script to the cluster, specifying the memory required by each job, wall time, etc."

    "text": "Using a config file to flexibly change grid requirements for particular rules\nOne natural issue with the above command is that some rules might require different cluster specifications than others.\nFor example, I‚Äôve written my bwa_align rule such that bwa mem will use 4 threads during alignment, and it‚Äôll probably use much more memory than downloading a reference genome.\nThankfully, Snakemake lets us create individual cluster specifications for each of our rules using a config file. See the example config file below, which is written in JSON.\n\"__default__\":\n\n{ \"memory\": \"8G\",\n  \"time\": \"1:0:0\",\n  \"threads\": \"1\",\n  \"os\": \"7\" },\n\n\"bwa_align\":\n\n{ \"memory\": \"4G\",\n  \"time\": \"8:0:0\",\n  \"threads\": \"4\",\n  \"os\": \"7\" }\nThen, when we run Snakemake, we could do the following:\nsnakemake -j 10 \\\n      --cluster-config /path/to/config.json \\\n      --cluster \\\n      --rerun-incomplete \\\n      \"qsub -l centos={cluster.os} -l mfree={cluster.memory} -l h_rt={cluster.time} -pe serial {cluster.threads}\""

This plot ignores the VCF calling steps, since the DAG gets pretty unweildy with that many steps!"
